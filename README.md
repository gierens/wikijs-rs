# wikijs-rs
API bindings, CLI client and FUSE filesystem for Wiki.js written in Rust.

# WARNING
This is a pre-release just to secure the crate name on crates.io and not
in a usable state yet, that's also why the repo is still private. The first
real version will be released in a few days, then I'll also publish the repo.
